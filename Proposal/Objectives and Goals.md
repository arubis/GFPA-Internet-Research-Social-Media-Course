We will accomplish our overarching goal by training 4-6 youth group leaders in:

  * Internet research skills, including iterative search, utilization of Wikipedia and similar resources, and determining the (authority/validity) of sources;
  * Social network usage, outreach, and group-organization skills;
  * Advocacy skills, particularly in conjunction with presenting researched topics
  * Training of third parties in their newfound skills
